# Code Snippets

### Here I've included some code snippets from some of my work on our project at my current company. The project is a web/mobile application which is a game combined with elements of a social media site. Users complete challenges to earn points which can be redeemed for rewards.
* The Daily Interactions Point Graph was used to calculate the percentage of a user's "daily point goal" achieved, and was displayed to them on the dashboard. 
* I have also included the "pending friend requests" page which handles the accepting and rejecting of incoming friend requests.
* The file TimePickerWrapper is a reusable component which was used for picking times throughout our app (mainly on the admin side for creating challenges), the data from which being added to the form-data ready to be stored to our DB.
* The CheckoutForm pre-populates the applicable address input fields from user data stored in localStorage, and then uses the Stripe API to create a transaction.
