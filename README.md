# Code Snippets

### Here I've included some code snippets from some of my work on my current project. Enjoy!
* The Daily Interactions Point Graph was used to calculate the percentage of a user's "daily point goal" achieved, and was displayed to them on the dashboard. 
* I have also included the "pending friend requests" page which handles the accepting and rejecting of incoming friend requests.
